<h2>Communicating with the Server</h2>
<p>
The simplest option is to write your program to accept two lines of STDIN:
</p>
<pre>
%opponent-previous-results%
%my-previous-results%
</pre>
<p>
You can use the dilemma runner in the following way:
</p>
<pre>
dilemma --server=serverip --name=name --runner=runner
</pre>
<p>
The lists are ordered with the most recent result being at the head of the list.
</p>
<p>
Once you have determined your move (either C for co-operate, or D for defect) this is written to STDOUT.
</p>
<h3>Installing the Runner</h3>
<p>
The runner is written using node so you will need node installed to install it locally.  Once installed, you should be able to install the runner:
</p>
<pre>
npm install -g dilemma
</pre>
<p>
As an alternative you can communicate directly with the server using ZMQ, and some simple demo clients (neither are good) are available here:

<p><a href="https://github.com/DamonOehlman/dilemma-clients/blob/master/zmq/haskell/dilemma.hs">Sample Haskell Client</a></p>
<p>
The raw protocol looks like the following (using a REQ client):
</p>
<pre>
CONNECT tcp://rtchub:1441
SENDMULTI ["reg", "team:strategy"]

forever $
    RECVMULTI

    - server tests if you are alive
    [ "ping" ] => SENDMULTI [ "pong" ]

    - run your strategy
    [ "iterate", $opponent_last ] => SENDMULTI [ "result", $my_move ]

    - reset your iteration information (it's a new opponent)
    [ "reset" ] => SENDMULTI [ "reset:ok" ]
